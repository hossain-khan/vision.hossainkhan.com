## The Cactus Pot 🏖️
The iconic red sandstone cliffs of Cavendish Beach stand as ancient sentinels along Prince Edward Island's northern shore. Known locally as "The Cactus Pot," these crimson formations have been sculpted by millennia of wind and waves, creating nature's masterpiece where earth meets sea. The striking rust-colored cliffs against the endless blue horizon tell a story of time, patience, and the raw beauty of Atlantic Canada.
