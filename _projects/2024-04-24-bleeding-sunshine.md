## Bleeding Sun by the Sea ðŸŒŠ
The sun was setting down the horizon behind the rock. The sun was bleeding, and the sea was the witness.

> "At the beach, life is different. Time doesnâ€™t move hour to hour but mood to moment. We live by the currents, plan by the tides, and follow the sun." â€“ Sandy Gingras
