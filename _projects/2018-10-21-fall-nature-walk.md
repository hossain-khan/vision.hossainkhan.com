## Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
The nature is full of beauty, you just have to stop of focus on them.
This shot is taken from the [Forks of the Credit](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/forksofthecredit) Provincial Park during end of fall season.

Would love to go back to the park for more hiking.
