## Crimson Carpet 🍂
Near Folly Lake along Highway 4 in Nova Scotia, autumn transforms the landscape into a breathtaking masterpiece. The ground becomes a vibrant crimson carpet as wild blueberry plants turn brilliant shades of red, contrasting beautifully against the golden hillsides and evergreen forests. This is nature's grand finale before winter's arrival—a spectacular display of color that reminds us of the beauty in every season's change.
