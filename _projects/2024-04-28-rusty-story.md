## Rusty story ⚓️
Time has decayed this bollard into a rusty relic, a testament to the passage of time and the relentless embrace of nature. It stands as a reminder of the stories it once held, now faded but not forgotten.

> "The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever." – Jacques Cousteau
