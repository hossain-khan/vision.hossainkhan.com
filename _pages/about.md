# About
I am super passionate about capturing moments.

I am software engineer by day, currently working on mobile application development and by night I am husband, son, brother and friend.
I just 💖 taking snaps of events, people and any related things.  

I'm a true believer of following quote and appreciate every moment I am living! 🙏 
> “_Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, **today** is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present._” - Bill Keane

## Current gears
I have recently started getting into photography with professional gears.

Here are my current gears:
* 📷 Camera Body: Canon EOS RP Mirrorless dSLR 
* ⭕ Lenses: 
  * Canon RF 24-105mm f/4-7.1 IS STM
  * Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 STM
  * Laowa 100mm f/2.8 2:1 Ultra Macro
* 🔦 Flash: Canon SpeedLite 600EX-RT

Besides main body, I like to take quick snaps with what I have with me, 
and 90% of the time it's my smart phone.
* 📱 Phone: Google Pixel 6 Pro
