## Exploring old city - Cusco
Cusco is a city in Peru where you stop by to visit Machu Picchu. Not knowing much about it made things even more exciting for me.
I have explored parts of this old city by walking around. This is where I also had the best Ceviche in Peru.

You could easily spend weeks, if not months, exploring the city and nearby attractions.
