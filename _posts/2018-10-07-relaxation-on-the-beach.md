## 🌊 Beach time 🏖
The sea beach is one of my favorite places to be on Earth.
There is something special about the waves! Their sound makes me calm and relaxed.

Now, go out there and find your "beach time"; it could be spending time with family, playing soccer, or anything you love to do that makes your mind relaxed.
