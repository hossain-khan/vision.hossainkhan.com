## Endless Love ❤️

Love is everywhere. It's in the air, in the water, in the sky, in the earth, in the universe. 

A popular symbol of love and commitment, love padlocks are often attached to bridges and other structures by couples as
a way to show their everlasting love. The padlocks are typically engraved with the couples' names or initials, and the
key is thrown away to symbolize the unbreakable bond between them.
