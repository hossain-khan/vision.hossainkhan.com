## Beacon of Hope 🗼

Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia—where the iconic lighthouse stands sentinel on ancient granite rocks, guiding mariners through the Atlantic waters. This timeless beacon has weathered countless storms, standing as a symbol of resilience and hope against the dramatic seascape. The raw beauty of this rugged coastline reminds us that even in the face of nature's power, there is grace, strength, and unwavering guidance.
