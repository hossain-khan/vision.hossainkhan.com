## 🌬️ In motion...
I was trying to capture some of the wild flower petals in motion. It did seem cool in front of the eye, but capturing it was not that easy.
It's most likely that I did not have a good contrasting background and the focal plane was not right.

Next time I should spend more time trying to get the perfect shot! Never give up! (Self-reminder 😊)
