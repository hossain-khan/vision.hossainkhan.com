## Mind is like sky
Every day gives us unique opportunity to view our surrounding differently. The sky constantly sifts and gives us millions combination of views.
I get excited with the views it creates, specially during sunset. Because, every second it shows different color.

This is a random view from my balcony before the sunset.
