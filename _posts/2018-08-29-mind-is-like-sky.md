## Mind is like sky
Every day gives us a unique opportunity to view our surroundings differently. The sky constantly shifts and gives us millions of combinations of views.
I get excited by the views it creates, especially during sunset. Because every second it shows a different color.

This is a random view from my balcony before the sunset.
