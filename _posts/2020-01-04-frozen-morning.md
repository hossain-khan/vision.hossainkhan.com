## A blissful surprise in the morning
When I got up on Saturday morning, I looked outside and was stunned by the view of a thin layer
of ice sitting on everything you could see.

This was not a typical snow day; it was just the right amount of snow that made things look beautiful.
I knew this wouldn't last long, so I grabbed my camera and started snapping the moment.
