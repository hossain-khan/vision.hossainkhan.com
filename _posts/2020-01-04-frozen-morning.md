## A blissful surprise in the morning
When I got up on Saturday morning, I looked outside and I was stuneed by the view of thin layer
of ice sitting on everything you can see.

This is not a typical snow day, it's just right amount of snow that makes things look beautiful.
I knew this won't last long, so, I grabbed my camera and started snapping the moment.
